An AI-powered Text-to-SQL dashboard that converts natural language queries into SQL commands, executes them on the Chinook database, and visualizes results using dynamic charts.

## 🚀 Features
1. Natural Language to SQL: Ask questions like "Show total sales by country".

2. Groq LLM Integration: Powered by Groq’s Llama-3 model for accurate SQL generation.

3. Dynamic Visualizations:

- Automatically selects chart types (bar, pie, line) based on query context.

- Automatically switches to a legend for pie charts with >8 slices to avoid overlap.

- Interactive Dashboard: Explore query results with a simple and intuitive interface.

4. SQLite Support: Runs queries on the Chinook sample database.

5. Error Handling: Cleans and validates SQL queries generated by the LLM.
